#### Non-Debian-based Linux distros

You will need to install Distrobox to create an Ubuntu environment, along with Docker.  Either use the terminal or your graphical package manager to install these.

Fedora:
`sudo dnf install distrobox docker`

OpenSUSE:
`sudo zypper install distrobox docker`

Arch:
`sudo pacman -S distrobox docker`


Add your user to the Docker group:
`sudo usermod -aG docker *username*`

Start the Docker service at boot:
`sudo systemctl start docker`
`sudo systemctl enable docker`

Reboot your system.

Now, create an Ubuntu container and enter it:
`distrobox create -n ubuntu --image ubuntu:24.04`
`distrobox enter ubuntu`

Note: After you create a password, check to see if you can run sudo.  If you’re not in the sudoer’s file, exit the distrobox with the exit command, and re-enter with:

`sudo docker exec -it ubuntu bash`

Now add your user to the sudo group.  Your username should be the same as on the host system.

`sudo usermod -a -G sudo *username*`

Exit and re-enter the distrobox normally.  You now have access to Apt.  Now download and install Pokeclicker from the link above.

`cd /path/to/pokeclicker.deb`
`sudo apt install ./pokeclicker.deb`

Now add Pokeclicker to your system menu:

`distrobox-export --app Pokeclicker`
