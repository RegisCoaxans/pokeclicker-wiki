## Leveling Strategy{#leveling}
Each mulch lasts the same amount of time, so it's cheapest to buy only [[Items/Boost Mulch]] to get to level 5 . Each Boost Mulch costs only 50 [[File:farmPoint.svg\|25px]] for a total of 59,100 [[File:farmPoint.svg\|25px]] to get to level 5, which is cheaper than if using other mulches. Having more then 1 farm plot mulched at the same time increases the speed at which the Sprinklotad gains levels, so evenly distribute the mulch over all 25 plots to minimize the time it takes to level it up.

Level | Number of Boost Mulches needed | Price (assuming you only buy at base price) |
:---: | :---: | :---:
1 | 80 | 4,000 [[File:farmPoint.svg\|25px]]
2 | 72 | 3,600 [[File:farmPoint.svg\|25px]]
3 | 194 | 9,700 [[File:farmPoint.svg\|25px]]
4 | 295 | 14,750 [[File:farmPoint.svg\|25px]]
5 | 541 | 27,050 [[File:farmPoint.svg\|25px]]
Total|1182| 59,100 [[File:farmPoint.svg\|25px]]

The number of mulches is rounded per level so the final total is greater than the number needed if you level the Sprinklotad from 0 to 5 in one sitting. If done all at once, you will need 1179 Boost Mulch which in turn costs 58,950 [[File:farmPoint.svg\|25px]].
